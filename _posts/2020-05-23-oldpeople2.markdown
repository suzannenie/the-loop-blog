Another resident's name is Jeffery. He suffers from Parkinson's and he cannot move very well nor speak clearly. But this middle aged asian man visits him nearly everyday, bringing goods and food to eat. I never asked assuming it was his friend, and they sit in the sunroom talking to each other through the glass windows because fuck quarantine. Today Jeffrey stopped to explain, saying that the man that visits him everyday is his "partner in life" and that he has him well trained. IDK, thought it was very cute and progressive of him to be so forthright given the fact that he is well into his 80s.
