There's this one really old woman, she goes by Lucy and is the epitome of asian grandma. Like three feet tall, hunched over, shuffle but weirdly fast, short hair. Anyway, today her daughter dropped off a big bouncy ball for her. Apparently she exercises by bouncing when she watches tv. I thought it was cute and the image of this tiny old person carrying a huge ball will remain a favorite for a while.
