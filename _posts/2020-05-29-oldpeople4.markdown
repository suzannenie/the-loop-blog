I'll keep this short and sweet because it speaks for itself. A resident called me in a panic asking me to get a caregiver to help her because she couldn't feel her legs. We all went into a stroke mentality, and carestaff came back later to tell me she had put on five pairs of pants and forgot, and then freaked out after waking up from a nap.
