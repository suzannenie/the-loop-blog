I wanted to put my hand next to it for scale in the picture but I was too scared
to get near it. I was going in the door and Joanne pointed and screamed and I jumped
out of my skin and ran into the street and nearly had a heart attack. I wasn't even that 
close to it and she really had to scare the living daylights out of me.
