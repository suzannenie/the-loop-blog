One resident whose name is Joan, is a particular pain in the arse most days. Today she demanded I change the lock on her door right this instance. I reasonably asked why, and she responded by saying that she heard someone at the door and she opened it for them. But she also said they unlocked it themselves, to which I asked why she had to open it for them, and then she popped off. I do not look forward to getting old at all folks.
