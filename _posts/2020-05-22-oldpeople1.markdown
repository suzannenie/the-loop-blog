There are two residents that live in the community where I work that I grew particularly fond of, their names are Granger and Sylvia. They both suffer from memory loss and are put in a program that helps with them. They grew to be best friends in that program, but due to quarantine we had to cancel all group events meaning that they no longer have that stimulus, making their memory loss much worse. Now Granger absolutely despises Sylvia for no reason because she keeps trying to hang out with him. He probably just simply forgot who she was, but Sylvia is also confused because she knows him as a friend but also doesn't understand why he spends all day avoiding her or yelling at her. Due to her memory loss she thinks that she did something wrong, and is constantly telling me how sad she is that she lost her best friend and she can't seem to figure out what she did wrong. To which I say she did nothing wrong, and she responds with I can't help but worry for him and us. This happens everyday, and I have this conversation at least twice a night and it truly is tragic.
