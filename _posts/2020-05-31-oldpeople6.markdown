There is this really persistent resident, named Doris. She constantly comes to the front desk to talk about her life. Our most recent blab fest (which lasted over an hour mind you) entailed her telling me how she was clairvoyant and can see the future. She told me she can only see events when they hurt people she cares about, which she followed up with that she wouldn't be able to see my futures... savage. But yes apparently she predicts anything and everything from car accidents, plane crashes, court orders and arrests, robberies and so on. Apparently she hears "voices" and "sees things"... crazy old women or prophet? It has yet to be decided.
